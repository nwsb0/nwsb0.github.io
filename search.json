    "section": "",
    "text": "In one of the tightest Most Valuable Player races we’ve seen over the last decade, all the signs point to the Joker cementing himself amongst the all-time greats.\nThe 2023-24 NBA season has been a wild roller coaster that no fan seems to want to get off. A stacked Western conference with 10 (!) teams that are currently above .500, an extremely competitive Eastern conference where seeds 2-8 weren’t finalized until the last final day of the regular season (April 14), and the aforementioned divisive MVP race, among so much more. There have been so many ups and downs for each team and individual player, but now there’s no time for excuses. Now that we’re here, as the curtain closes on the season, many pundits, journalists, analysts, former players, etc. will all ask the same, all-important question:\nWho is the 2023-24 MVP?\nThis blog will show you why you shouldn’t be shocked when Nikola Jokic begrudgingly earns his third MVP award in the last four seasons and becomes the ninth player ever to win three times. If chosen, Jokic will join quite an elite list: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (6), Bill Russell (5), Michael Jordan (5), LeBron James (4), Wilt Chamberlain (4), Moses Malone (3), Larry Bird (3), and Magic Johnson (3).\nWhen we look at someone as the MVP of a season, what criteria are we looking for them to meet? The answer to that question will vary from person to person as this is an award that can take on many factors pertaining to the players’ respective “value,” but we can use advanced statistics to make our best assumptions from the data we’ve been provided.\nIf we’re strictly looking at the numbers, one of the advanced stats that gives us a good baseline for where to look for this award is Player Efficiency Rating (PER). Here are the top 10 from 2023-24.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nnbaadvanced &lt;- read_csv(\"nbaadvanced_updated.csv\")\n\ntenwinsharesandpositiveBPM &lt;- nbaadvanced |&gt;\n  filter(BPM &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  filter (WS &gt;= 10)\n\njokic &lt;- nbaadvanced |&gt;\n  filter(Player == \"Nikola Jokić\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=tenwinsharesandpositiveBPM, aes(x=reorder(Player, PER), weight=PER), fill=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=jokic, aes(x=reorder(Player, PER), weight=PER), fill=\"green\") + coord_flip() + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Player Name\", \n    y=\"Player Efficiency Rating (PER)\", \n    title=\"The MVP race has been extremely tight this year, but can anyone catch the Joker?\", \n    subtitle=\"Every NBA MVP since 2015-16 has either led the league in PER, or posted a PER over 30.0. This year, there's only one man who has maintained both...\", \n    caption=\"\n    Source: Basketball Reference | Noah Buchholtz\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 13, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=7), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis excludes some players who missed majority of the season due to injury, like reigning MVP Joel Embiid who posted a 34.1 PER, but only played 39 games.\nPER does a solid job of summarizing a players entire entire game into one simple number, but doesn’t do a fantastic job of highlighting the defensive performance of a player. In years past, Jokic has been given some relatively justified criticism for his play on the defensive side of the floor, but if you haven’t watched some games or taken a peak at the numbers, the “Joker” completely flipped the script this year.\n\n\nCode\nbestdefenders &lt;- nbaadvanced |&gt;\n  filter(DWS &gt; 4) |&gt;\n  filter(DBPM &gt; 0)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data=bestdefenders, \n    aes(x=DWS, y=DBPM),\n    color=\"black\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=jokic, \n    aes(x=DWS, y=DBPM),\n    color=\"green\") +\n  geom_smooth(\n    data=bestdefenders, \n    aes(x=DWS, y=DBPM), \n    method=\"lm\", se=FALSE) + \n   ggrepel::geom_text_repel(\n    data=bestdefenders, \n    aes(x=DWS, y=DBPM, label=Player)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Defensive Win Shares\", \n    y=\"Defensive Box +/-\", \n    title=\"Is 2023-24 Nikola Jokic... an elite defender?\", \n    subtitle=\"After years of receving criticism for his defensive restrictions, the Serbian turned one of his only weaknesses into one of his sneakiest tools in an ever-expanding bag of tricks.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | Noah Buchholtz\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=6), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the reigning Finals MVP leads the league in defensive box plus minus and ranks behind only Rudy Gobert — who is likely to be named Defensive Player of the Year for the fourth time in his career — in defensive win shares. Both of these stats aren’t complete indicators of individual defensive skill, however, they do convey to the readers how much of an impact these players make to their team on that side of the ball as a whole. Blocks and steals are awesome, but they don’t grasp the full magnitude of what defense entails.\nSo according to the stats this season, Jokic has been the most efficient player in the entire league, while also being one of the most impactful defenders. To fully grasp his influence, this chart shows his overall win shares and box plus/minus, with the size of the dot scaled by the players value over a(n) (average) replacement player, otherwise known as VORP (NBA version of WAR). To break it down a little further, VORP calculates a box-score estimate of the points per 100 team possessions that a player scores over a replacement level player, translated to the average team over a full season.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=nbaadvanced, \n    aes(x=WS, y=BPM, size=VORP), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.5) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=jokic, \n    aes(x=WS, y=BPM, size=VORP), \n    color=\"green\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(\n    data=tenwinsharesandpositiveBPM, \n    aes(x=WS, y=BPM, label=Player)\n  ) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Win Shares\", \n    y=\"Estimated total box +/-\", \n    title=\"The 2023-24 MVP race has felt extremely close, but is it really?\", \n    subtitle=\"Nikola Jokic, the advanced stat darling, has done it once again.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | By Noah Buchholtz\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJokic’s VORP this year finished at 10.53, the highest of his career and the highest in the NBA. For those that do not know, Jokic posted a 9.81 in 2021-22, which at the time, ranked as the 14th-best seasonal VORP since they started recording it as an official stat in the 1973-74 season. His number from this year will now rank as the 8th best of all-time, moving his 2021-22 digit down to 15.\nIf Jokic does snag his third MVP, where does he rank all-time? What about on the all-time centers list? I’m not going to make your decision for you, but out of everyone on the list he’s about to join, I promise you he cares about his ranking the least."

    "text": "At this time of year, there’s always debates around the big awards like Most Valuable Player (MVP), Defensive Player of the Year (DPoY), Rookie of the Year (RotY), etc. and predictions for the All-NBA teams, but let’s ignore that for now. These awards are great and are usually well deserved by the players, but for the casual fan who may not get to watch most of the regular season, they just mean that this guy was the best at whatever category the award is for — which is also a fair assumption. However, in a league where offensive output is at an all-time high, the NBA doesn’t have many awards to celebrate individual offensive excellence or player’s who do it at an extremely high efficiency. Due to this, this project’s goal is to provide an easier way to view the data and observe who were the best and most efficient offensive players in the NBA this year, and crown our Efficiency Champ for 2023-24.\nWhen we look at a player’s scoring, the baskets always fall in to one of three categories — two-pointers, three-pointers, and free throws. Of course, professionals need to be fantastic at making these shots, but to be an elite scorer in today’s NBA, there’s one category that can tend to dominate a game by itself — free throws. The highest level offensive players in the game can manipulate a defense and force the other team into situations that they aren’t comfortable, and nothing does that more effectively than drawing fouls and putting the opponent in foul trouble. To view which players have been most productive from the foul line, here’s every player this season who average 20.0 points per game or more, while also shooting 10.0 free throw attempts or more per 100 possessions.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nnbaadv &lt;- read_csv(\"2024nbaadvancedstats.csv\")\nnba100pos &lt;- read_csv(\"nbaadvancedEoS.csv\")\nnba100posFTA &lt;- nba100pos |&gt;\n  filter(PTS &gt; 20.0) |&gt;\n  filter(FTA &gt; 10.0)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=nba100posFTA, aes(x=reorder(Player, FTA), weight=FTA), fill=\"purple\") + coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Free Throws Attempted per 100 possessions\", \n    title=\"Which players lived at the line in 2023-24?\", \n    subtitle=\"Free throws alone can't tell the full story of a scorer's production or the level they're at, but the elite get there with ease.\", \n    caption=\"\n    Source: Basketball Reference | Noah Buchholtz\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 17, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=7), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, Joel Embiid is running away with the lead in this category. Embiid has perfected this part of the game, using his size, athleticism, footwork, and touch to glide his way to 30+ points a night… when healthy. Outside of Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo is the only player within a reasonable range, but the lower part of this list can still tell us a lot. There are obviously a few more stars there like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Luka Doncic, Jimmy Butler, Zion Williamson, DeMar DeRozan and Trae Young, but some of the lesser known, younger players on the list could have bright futures ahead. None of these players played anywhere near the same amount of minutes that the stars did, but statistics like this can provide a glimpse into what their production could look like with more development, or even just more minutes.\nOnce again, free throws are great, but they don’t tell the full story for what we’re trying to find. No matter if you get to the line or not, you have to be efficient with the shots you take. To see who was the best at that this season, we will take a look at each player’s true shooting percentage — half the points scored divided by the sum of the field goals attempted and 0.475 times the free throws attempted — and player efficiency rating (PER) — a extremely complicated formula that summarizes the entirety of a player’s individual stats — with their free throw rate as the size of the dot.\n\n\nCode\nnbabestoff &lt;- nbaadv |&gt;\n  filter(MP &gt; 1850) |&gt;\n  filter(OBPM &gt; 0.0) |&gt;\n  filter(OWS &gt; 5.0)\n\nbestscorers &lt;- nbaadv |&gt;\n  rename(\"TSp\" = \"TS%\") |&gt;\n  filter(PER &gt; 20.0) |&gt;\n  filter(MP &gt; 1700) |&gt;\n  filter(TSp &gt; .60)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=bestscorers, \n    aes(x=PER, y=TSp, size=FTr), \n    color=\"purple\", \n    alpha=.5) +  \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 20) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = .60) +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(\n    data=bestscorers, \n    aes(x=PER, y=TSp, label=Player)\n  ) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Player Efficiency Rating\", \n    y=\"True Shooting percentage\", \n    title=\"The NBA's Elite Executioners\", \n    subtitle=\"Using two of the best advanced metrics, this graph shows us where the best of the best rank amongst each other in terms of efficiency, regardless of shot selection or playstyle.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | By Noah Buchholtz\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=7), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the right side of the graph, we have the upper-echelon. Players like likely-MVP Nikola Jokic, Gilegous-Alexander, Antetokounmpo & Doncic have all had absurd seasons in comparison to the mean in almost every efficiency category. Now if you look at the left side of the graph, you’ll see a more diverse size and scatter of dots. Players like Kyrie Irving, Steph Curry and Tyrese Haliburton are extremely efficient, but don’t get to the line hardly at all, restricting further production. Then lastly, if you look at the top of the graph, you’ll see Mavericks center Daniel Gafford. Gafford has always been an extremely efficient finisher around the rim, but his run earlier this season of 33 consecutive made field goals placed him second on the all-time list (Wilt, 35) and boosted his TS% to the second highest single season number of all-time, ranking behind Rudy Gobert’s 73.2% in 2021-22.\nNow that we’ve seen their ability to get to the line and be efficient with their shots, we finally need to seize a full understanding of each player’s offensive impact. This is a hard thing to do without watching the games, but there are a few advanced statistics that can provide as training wheels. For this, we will be using OWS and OBPM. Offensive win shares (OWS) is credited using the following formula: (marginal offense) / (marginal points per win). This was invented by Dean Oliver who credits players based on his formula for points produced and offensive possessions. Offensive box plus/minus (OBPM) is less of an exact stat, but still uses score-based metrics to estimate a player’s contribution when on the court. This stat is usually divided into OBPM and DBPM (defensive), then added together to find total box plus/minus (BPM).\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data=nbabestoff, \n    aes(x=OWS, y=OBPM),\n    color=\"purple\") +\n  geom_smooth(\n    data=nbabestoff, \n    aes(x=OWS, y=OBPM), \n    method=\"lm\") +\n   ggrepel::geom_text_repel(\n    data=nbabestoff, \n    aes(x=OWS, y=OBPM, label=Player)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Offensive Win Shares\", \n    y=\"Offensive Box +/-\", \n    title=\"Ignoring defense, which stars had the highest offensive impact?\", \n    subtitle=\"According to our data, this group of players were the top-15 most impactful players on the offensive end in 2023-24. Once again, the Joker reigns supreme.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | Noah Buchholtz\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=7), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, we can see that the likely top four in MVP voting this year — Jokic, Doncic, Gilegous-Alexander, and Antetokounmpo — are on a different level from everyone else in the league at the moment on the offensive end. And for the fourth year in a row, Nikola Jokic is running away with my figurative “Efficiency Champ” award — whilst ranking just 15th in total FTA this season . With the absurd level he has maintained, it would be crazy to think someone could overtake him, so now the question is, will he ever slow down this pace or production? If so, when? Either way, appreciate the Big Tipper while he’s here before he disappears back to Serbia to do what he loves: racing horses."
